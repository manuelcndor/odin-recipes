    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Ceviche de conchas negras is a bold and intensely flavored version of traditional ceviche, made with black
        scallops native to Peru’s northern coast. These dark, nutrient-rich shellfish have a distinctive briny taste and
        are served raw, “cooked” in lime juice just like fish ceviche. The conchas are mixed with sliced red onions, ají
        limo, chopped cilantro, and a splash of lime juice—sometimes enhanced with a bit of garlic or Peruvian beer for
        depth.</p>
    <p> This dish stands out for its inky color and uniquely rich, almost umami-forward flavor. It’s often enjoyed as a
        beachside delicacy, especially in Piura or Tumbes, and is prized not only for its taste but also for its
        supposed aphrodisiac properties. Served chilled, usually with cancha (toasted corn), sweet potato, or even
        chifles (plantain chips), it’s a true gem of Peru’s coastal cuisine.</p>
