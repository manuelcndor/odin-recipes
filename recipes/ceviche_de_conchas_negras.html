    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Ceviche de conchas negras is a bold and intensely flavored version of traditional ceviche, made with black
        scallops native to Peru’s northern coast. These dark, nutrient-rich shellfish have a distinctive briny taste and
        are served raw, “cooked” in lime juice just like fish ceviche. The conchas are mixed with sliced red onions, ají
        limo, chopped cilantro, and a splash of lime juice—sometimes enhanced with a bit of garlic or Peruvian beer for
        depth.</p>
    <p> This dish stands out for its inky color and uniquely rich, almost umami-forward flavor. It’s often enjoyed as a
        beachside delicacy, especially in Piura or Tumbes, and is prized not only for its taste but also for its
        supposed aphrodisiac properties. Served chilled, usually with cancha (toasted corn), sweet potato, or even
        chifles (plantain chips), it’s a true gem of Peru’s coastal cuisine.</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 24 fresh black clams (conchas negras) </li>
        <li> Juice of 10 limes </li>
        <li> 1 large red onion </li>
        <li> 1 medium ají limo (or hot pepper), thinly sliced</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon minced garlic </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon ground rocoto (or substitute with another hot chili paste) </li>
        <li> Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse and clean 24 black clams, discarding any with broken shells. Slice the meat into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li> Place the sliced clams in a bowl and pour in the juice of 10 limes. Gently toss to coat.
        </li>
        <li> Add 1 large diced red onion, 1 thinly sliced ají limo, 1 tbsp minced garlic, and 1 tbsp chili paste. Season
            with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Let the mixture rest in the fridge for 5–10 minutes, stirring once or twice to ensure even “cooking” by the
            citrus.
        </li>
        <li> Stir in 2 tbsp chopped cilantro just before serving.
        </li>
        <li> Plate chilled ceviche and accompany with choclo, sliced sweet potato, and cancha or chifles.
        </li>
