    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Pollo a la brasa, sometimes translated as “blackened chicken” or “charcoal chicken,” is Peru’s signature
        rotisserie dish characterized by its smoky aroma and golden, crisp skin. A whole chicken is rubbed with a secret
        marinade—commonly made from vinegar or lime juice, dark beer, soy sauce, garlic, cumin, ají panca paste, and
        fresh herbs—and left to marinate overnight. It’s traditionally roasted on a rotisserie over hardwood charcoal,
        which infuses the meat with a deep, savory flavor while keeping it juicy and tender. </p>
    <p> Served alongside thick-cut French fries, a simple green salad, and often accompanied by creamy ají verde or
        other chili pepper–based sauces, pollo a la brasa is ubiquitous in Peru’s “pollerías” and celebrated nationwide.
        Every third Sunday of July, Peruvians commemorate Día del Pollo a la Brasa, underlining its status as the
        country’s most beloved dish, with up to 70% of diners naming it their favorite meal to eat out. </p>
