    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Ceviche is Peru’s most iconic dish, known for its fresh, zesty flavors and bold simplicity. It’s typically made
        from raw white fish—like sea bass or corvina—marinated in freshly squeezed lime juice, which “cooks” the fish by
        denaturing the proteins. The fish is mixed with sliced red onions, a touch of chili pepper (often ají limo), and
        seasoned with salt and cilantro. </p>
    <p> It’s traditionally served with sides like sweet potato and Peruvian corn (choclo), whose softness and starch
        balance the tangy punch of the citrus marinade. Ceviche is a symbol of Peruvian culinary pride, celebrated for
        its harmony of textures and regional variations. It’s best enjoyed freshly prepared, often as a midday meal,
        especially along the coast where the catch is at its freshest. </p>
